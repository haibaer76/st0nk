FAQ:
== F: What is st0nk?
A: st0nk is a new approach for making laws in a kind of the system open source
development. If you are not staisfied with the current laws, why not fork your
own?

== F: Is st0nk a tool for Liquid Democracy?
A: No. st0nk is politics 2.0. And it is currently planned only as a tool for
grass roots democracy where erverybody of a certain group (for example a
democratically organized political party) can give a vote which of the existing
forks should be "official" vote of this organisation.

== st0nk -- Software for a grass groots democracy 2.0

The current status of the project is pre-alpha. 

This Rails project is a prototype for a "better wiki". Current wikis have a problem:
There is no possibility to make branches like in a software project.

Because I think that politics has much similarity with software development, one
should use the tools and methods used for software development to develop the
rules of a society.

== The Wiki

Basically spoken, st0nk is a wiki with a version control system (git) as backend
storage which allows you to branch, merge and cherrypick in simple wiki pages
(documents).

Every document can have an arbitary number of branches. The creator of a new
branch (a user with a valid login) sets a commit policy for his branch, where he
will be able to choose one of four:
1. public: Everybody with or without a valid login
2. user: Only users which are loged in
3. own: Only the creator
4. vote: Commits to this branch must be voted (see "Voting")


== The Voting

For the voting there should be a list of valid voting keys. The keys are
generated and checked by a foreign system. st0nk only has to know how many votes
are needed for a commit.
